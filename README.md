# Assembler
This program, written in C on a Linux machine, functions as an assembler code. Its purpose is to take assembly language code as input and convert it into machine code using a two-step process.

During the first run, the code traverses the file, searching for any errors and keeping a count of them. If any errors are detected, they are displayed on the screen.

In the second run, the code iterates over the assembly language code again, this time converting it into machine code.

The "makefile" included in the project comprises a set of instructions that define how to compile, build, and link the software project. It specifies the target and its dependencies.

This code was developed as part of an assignment for the System Programming course at the Open University and received a final grade of 98.
