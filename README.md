# asembler
assmbler code written in c on a linux machine.

this program receives assembly language code and converts it into machine code using two "runs".

on the the first run the code goes thro the file and look for errors, counting them and prints them to the screen if any was found.

the second run goes over the code again and converts it into machine code.

the make file is a set of instructions that specify how to compile, build, and link a software project in the form of Target: dependencies.

this code was written as an assignment at the Open University as part of the  system progreming course.
